# Site-To-Site-VPN

Virtual Private Network (VPN) It refers to a connection set up between multiple networks. It prioritizes private and protected traffic. 

## Remote Access VPN's
It is a temporary connection set up between two ore more users and a central location. It is usually used to give each user access to a data center. In some cases a connection that uses Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is sufficient. However, a lot of organization utilize a VPN.

## Intranet-based Site-to-Site
This connects more than one LAN to form a WAN. A company may use this to incorporate software-defined WAN (SD-WAN). Useful for combining disparate offices securely, as if they were all in the same location. This can be helpful if each site develops its own resources or uses a unique process that the entire company would benefit from having access to. 

## Extranet-Based Site-to-Site
Extranet-based site-to-site VPNs are often used by two or more different companies that want to share certain resources but keep others private. With an extranet-based site-to-site VPN, each entity connects to the VPN and chooses what they want to make available to the other companies. In this way, they can collaborate and share without exposing proprietary data.
