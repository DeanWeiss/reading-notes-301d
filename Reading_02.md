# What is Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?
<br>
Domains are usually made up of computers on the same LAN. Though, they can also join using a VPN or internet connection so that someone can remote in. 
Passwords and Usernames are monitored and controlled by the Domain Controller. Logging into a server allows it to authenticate you.
<br>
<br>
Network Admins can change group policys on the domain controller to effect each PC on the domain. Because of this, most settings can not be change on the end-user PC. Because domaines aren't for home users, you need a Professional or Enterprise version of Windows.
<br>
<br>
Your home computer is not on a domain as it usually the purview of larger organization. But you can check by going to System Information and look under Computer name, domain and workgroup settings. It will show you if you are and the name of it.
<br>
<br>
If yor are not part of domain you could be part of a workgroup. The main difference being that the computers on a workgroup are part of a LAN where no single computer has control over the others, all are equal. Workgroups also don't require passwords.
