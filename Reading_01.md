# Difference Between Windows and Windows Server
<br>
<br>
Windows and Windows Server can both have a similar GUI. However, WIndows recommends disabling the GUI for the Server and using the command line.
<br>
<br>
After Windows Server loads, and the GUI is installed, it will load up a list of specific serve features such as DHCP Services and Active Directory Domain Services. These features allow deployment of an OS remotely to other machines. Windows Server also supports features like SMB Direct and Resilient File Systems. Only Windows 10 Pro has the features on the workstation.
<br>
<br>
Windows Server also supports more powerful hardware. Windows 10 Pro has a max limit of 2TB of RAM while the Server allows for 24TB.  Windows 10 Home edition supports one physical CPU and Pro supports two. A 32-bit version of Windows only supports 32 COres and 64 up to 246 Cores. Windows Server has no limits for cores.
<br>
<br>
Windows Server does not have Cortana, the Microsoft Store, Edge or Timeline. The Server still uses Internet Explorer. It also doesnâ€™t support signing in with your Microsoft account, so no bringing over settings from another PC. Must have a local or domain account. Windows Server can also disable updates entirely through group policy, while WIndows 10 Home can pause them. 
<br>
<br>
The Windows Server is more expensive. A single license can cost between 500 and 6200 dollars. It is primarily made for businesses.

## Things I want to know more about
<br>
For larger businesses, are the maximums for a server easy to reach? Is it best practice to fill one of these servers to a certain percentage before using a second one?
